You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible, and deploy your algorithm on real robots utilizing ROS platform.
Your goal is to write a reward function for the environment that will help the agent learn the task described in text as well as maintaining real-world safety instructions.
Your reward function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs.
{reward_sign}
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors.
