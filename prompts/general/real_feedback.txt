Real world feedback:

We deployed the trained RL policy to our robot and evaluated its performance in reality. We converted the reward functions that can be calculated by real-world sensors and actuators, and calculated real-world reward terms. Please note that the feedback obtained from real-world operations is authentic but may contain noise. You need to pay attention to the differences between the feedback collected from the real world and that from the simulated environment. We tracked the operation results for {oper_time} seconds, here are the results of the evaluation:
