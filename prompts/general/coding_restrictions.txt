Important restrictions for writing the reward function code:
    (1) Most importantly, the reward code's must only use attributes of the provided environment object (namely, variables that have prefix env.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
    (2) Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the environment tensors.
    (3) Reward functions with `_gt_` inside are used for monitoring custom reward function behavior. Under no circumstance can you include `_gt_` in your reward function name.
